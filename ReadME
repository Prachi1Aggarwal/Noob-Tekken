NOOB TEKKEN

About: This little bit based on Retro fighting games, took the motivation from our favourite game Tekken.
        I said NOOB TEKKEN because to its basicity.

How to play: 

Enter in the game and click on play button
A pop up box will come and asked you to enter your move to fight.

##############################################################
# Enter A -> for punch                                       #
# Enter B -> for Kick                                        #
# Enter C -> for using super attack                          #
# Enter D -> to dodge some limited attacks                   #

How it works: 
When you enter your move <computer will enter its own move behind the scene> 
now rules are hidden for PURPOSE 
(BECAUSE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ON LUCK AS THE RULES ARE ONLY KNOWN TO <DEVELOPER>)ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

Whose all 5 HPs down first will be the LOOSER 
and winner will be our NOOB TEKKER
